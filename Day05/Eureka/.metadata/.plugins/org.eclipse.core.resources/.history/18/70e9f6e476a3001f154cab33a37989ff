Eureka is an important and essential part of architecture
Hence we must take care of following 2 things
	i. Securing Eureka - The idea is eah microservice trying to register itself
	with eureka must first authenticatr itself. If authentication is successfull, thn
	only eureka allows microservice to register
	Steps:
	1. Add spring security dependency
	2. Write username and pass
	3. Should make the authentication basic from form based
	
form based used for web apps [user to app]
http basic used for webservices [app to app]
